# heaRtbeat
R package for exploring and reporting survey data. Heartbeat analysis was designed to shift reporting survey statistics from the percent favorable metric to the number of respondents answering the question more favorably than other questions on the same survey (called an up-vote). Heartbeat analysis was awarded the Wiley Award for Excellence in Survey Research by the Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology in 2021. This R package simplifies the calculation of up-votes and down-votes for researchers interested in the award-winning methodology.
