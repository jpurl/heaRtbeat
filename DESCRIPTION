Description: Transforms survey data into upvotes/downvotes using Heartbeat
    Analysis. Heartbeat analysis was designed to shift reporting survey
    statistics from the percent favorable metric to the
    number of respondents answering the question more favorably
    than other questions on the same survey, called an up-vote.
    Heartbeat analysis was awarded the Wiley Award
    for Excellence in Survey Research by the
    Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology in 2021.
